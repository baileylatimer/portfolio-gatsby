  ### **Who is GoSun?**

    GoSun makes solar products for outdoor enthusiasts. To compete with new and rapidly-growing entrants in the outdoor recreation market, GoSun invited me to evolve and reinvent the brand & e-commerce experience for modern-day customers.

  Like many DTC brands of late, they grew a large following via crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Once these campaigns ended, they struggled to keeping  momentum going on their own site.

  That's where I came in.

  ### We've got work to do.

    GoSun needed help with usability, visual consistancy, and information architecture. They had short “startup” deadlines and had experienced lackluster results from other design companies.

  * Home page

    ## Home, sweet home.

    My goal for the homepage was to create a warm, inviting experience for our users. Users rely on the homepage figure out the type of site they are on, and rely on categories to decide if they should continue further. Previously, it lacked categories, so that was step 1.

  * Product page

    ## All about conversion.

      Before the redesign, users were overwhelmed with a cluttered interface. The CTA was unclear and below the fold on mobile. Using eye-tracking heatmaps and screen-recording software, I identified pain points and restructured the page accordingly.

    ## Pick a card, any card

      For editors, I designed a flexible system of sections, storytelling components that let them tell each story in a way that fits it. Your design is only as good as it's **documented, approved, shared,** and followed by your team.
